Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n","\n","1. Addition: The addition operator (`+`) is used to add two or more numbers. For example: `2 + 3 = 5`.\n","\n","2. Subtraction: The subtraction operator (`-`) is used to subtract one number from another. For example: `5 - 2 = 3`.\n","\n","3. Multiplication: The multiplication operator (`*`) is used to multiply two or more numbers. For example: `2 * 3 = 6`.\n","\n","4. Division: The division operator (`/`) is used to divide one number by another. For example: `6 / 3 = 2`.\n","\n","5. Exponentiation: The exponentiation operator (`**` or `^`) is used to raise a number to a power. For example: `2 ** 3 = 8` or `2^3 = 8`.\n","\n","6. Modulo: The modulo operator (`%`) is used to find the remainder after division.
